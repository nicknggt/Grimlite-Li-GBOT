**NOTE: There might be some gbots that are in progress so be careful for not to use it after downloading, normally these gbots are appeared in the latest date modified but our team will try our best to finish it before committing**

**ALSO NOTE: These GBOT files only worked for GrimLi. Other [Grimoire software](https://auqw.tk/) WON'T WORK. Same thing for other Grim software GBOT(s) which also won't work in GrimLi**
